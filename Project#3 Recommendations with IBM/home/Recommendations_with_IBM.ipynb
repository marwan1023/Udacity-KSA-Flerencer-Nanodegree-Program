We could implement A/B testing to see the results of the old recommendations vs the new recommendations. The old recommendations will be the control where the new recommendations are the experiment. The experiment could randomly sample two different populations of IMB readers giving one group the old recommender and one group the new recommender. We could also explore the effectiveness of recommendations by exploring metrics of customer satisfaction. We could explore metrics such as reader churn, reader bounce rate, reader retention rates, change in revenue, reader time spent on the website, number of new readers etc.\n",
    "- Funk SVD easily allow us to find a way to evaluate our recommendation engine and to create good U and V^T matrices in order to make recommendations even if we have a very sparse matrix. But Funk SVD shouldn’t be used alone, because we can be faced with a common problem in recommendation engine called “Cold Start Problem”. This problem means, that we can’t make a recommendation for new users or new movies. A good approach is to combine Funk SVD with a less advanced method like a Ranked Based algorithm or Content-based."
